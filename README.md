# ChurnRecommendarSystem 
Churn rate is the annual percentage rate at which customers stop subscribing to a service or employees leave a job.<br>
It is very important for companies to know whether a customer will stay with them or not, if not, then find out the reason why and make business-related decisions.<br>

A churn prediction analysis has been done using the Telco-Churn dataset from Kaggle.
<br>The code helps analyse the various features due to which a customer might leave the organization.
<br>Data is preprocessed,explored, visualized and then predictions on whether the customer will leave or stay is made using Tensorflow and Keras library in pyhton.
<br>Other libraries used:
<br>Data preprocessing and exploring- Numpy,Pandas.
<br>Data visualization- Matplotlib, Seaborn.
